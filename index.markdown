# Welcome to The Model Factory

On this site we try to collect a variety of software models, discuss them, and most of all look at them from the point of view of an analyst, modeler.

Have a look at our [articles](Article) and [patterns collections](Pattern).

<div class="notice" markdown="true">
  We recently moved from our previous Mediawiki-based site to these [GitHub](http://github.com) hosted [Pages](http://pages.github.com). The most important parts of the old wiki are now moved over here. Over the coming months we will be further expanding this new home.

  Feel free to join in, fork the [repository](http://github.com/christophevg/themodelfactory.org) and send in pull requests!
